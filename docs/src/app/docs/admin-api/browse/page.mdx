# Browse

The `browse` method is used to get a list of items from a Ghost Admin API resource, it is the equivalent of the `GET /members` endpoint. You have access to different options to paginate, limit, filter and order your results.

## Options

These options are totally _optionals_ on the `browse` method but they let you filter and order your search.

This is an example containing all the available keys in the params object

```ts
import { TSGhostAdminAPI } from "@ts-ghost/admin-api";

const api = new TSGhostAdminAPI(
  "https://demo.ghost.io",
  "1efedd9db174adee2d23d982:4b74dca0219bad629852191af326a45037346c2231240e0f7aec1f9371cc14e8",
  "v6.0",
);

let query = api.posts.browse({
  page: 1,
  limit: 5,
  filter: "name:bar+slug:-test",
  //      ^? the text here will throw a TypeScript lint error if you use unknown fields.
  order: "title DESC",
  //      ^? the text here will throw a TypeScript lint error if you use unknown fields.
});
```

These browse params are then parsed through a `Zod` Schema that will validate all the fields.

### page `number`

Lets you query a specific page of results. The default value is `1` and pagination starts at `1`.

### limit `number` | `"all"`

Lets you limit the number of results per page. The default value is `15` and the maximum value is `15` (limitation of the Ghost API).
You can also pass the literal string `"all"` to get all the results.

### filter `string`

Lets you filter the results with the [Ghost API `filter` syntax](https://ghost.org/docs/admin-api/#filtering). But with the power of TypeScript, you will get **lint errors if you use unknown fields**.

For example if you use `filter: "name:bar+slug:-test"`, `name` IS NOT a field of the `Post` resource, you will get a lint error.

Example, getting all featured posts except one with specific slug:

```ts
const slugToExclude = "test";

let query = await api.posts
  .browse({
    filter: `featured:true+slug:-${slugToExclude}`,
  })
  .fetch();
```

Note that you also have access to nested fields.

_`filter` is hard to type, if you find any issues where the type shows an error but the query works,
please open an issue._

### order `string`

Lets you order the results by fields. Similar to the `filter` option, you will get **TypeScript lint errors if you use unknown fields**. The syntax is `field direction` where `direction` is `ASC` or `DESC`.

```ts
let query = await api.posts
  .browse({
    order: "title DESC",
  })
  .fetch();
```

Note that you can also use nested properties, for example if you want to fetch the first 3 `Tags` with the most posts:

```ts
api.tags
.browse({
  order: "count.posts DESC",
  filter: "visibility:public",
  limit: 3,
})
.include({ "count.posts": true })
.fetch(),
```

## Output modifiers

After calling `browse` you get a Fetcher instance that you can use to optionnaly alter the output of the result with methods like `include`, `fields` and `formats`. You can also use the `fetch` method to get the result.

There is a section [dedicated to output modifiers here](/docs/admin-api/output-modifiers).

## Fetching the data

After using browse query, you will get a `BrowseFetcher` with 2 methods:

- `async fetch`
- `async paginate`

That result is a discriminated union with the Boolean `success` as a discriminator, so a check on `success` will let you know if the query was successful or not. Generally your workflow will look like that:

```ts
let result = await api.posts.browse().fetch();
if (result.success) {
  const posts = result.data;
  //     ^? type Post[]
} else {
  // errors array of objects
  console.log(result.errors.map((e) => e.message).join("\n"));
}
```

### Result type of `.fetch()`

The `data` property of the result will be an array of objects of the resource you queried. This output schema will be modified according to the output modifiers you used.

**Basic example for Posts** (without output modifiers you get the full Post object):

```ts
// example for the browse query (the data is an array of objects)
const result: {
    success: true;
    data: Post[];
    meta: {
        pagination: {
            pages: number;
            limit: number;
            page: number;
            total: number;
            prev: number | null;
            next: number | null;
        };
    };
} | {
    success: false;
    errors: {
        message: string;
        type: string;
    }[];
}
```

### Result type of `.paginate()`

Paginate is a method that will return a cursor and a `next` fetcher to directly have the next query with the same parameters but on page n + 1. See a complete example in the [Common Recipes](/docs/admin-api/common-recipes) section.

```ts
const result: {
    success: true;
    data: Post[];
    meta: {
        pagination: {
            pages: number;
            limit: number | "all";
            page: number;
            total: number;
            prev: number | null;
            next: number | null;
        };
    };
    next: BrowseFetcher | undefined; // the next page fetcher if it is defined
} | {
    success: false;
    errors: {
        message: string;
        type: string;
    }[];
    next: undefined; // the next page fetcher is undefined here
}
```

Here you can use the `next` property to get the next page fetcher if it is defined.
