# Read

The `read` method is used to one item from a Ghost Admin API resource, it is the equivalent of the `GET /posts/slug/this-is-a-slug` endpoint. You have to give it an identity field to fetch the resource.

## Options

Options for the read method depends on the resource you are querying. Each resource have a specific identity field that you can use to fetch it.

For example, the `Post` resource will have `id` and `slug` as identity fields but the `Member` resource will only have `id`. On the other hand the `User` resource will have `id`, and `email` as identity fields.

**Use TypeScript autocomplete to guide you through the available identity fields.**

```ts
import { TSGhostAdminAPI } from "@ts-ghost/admin-api";

const api = new TSGhostAdminAPI(
  "https://demo.ghost.io",
  "1efedd9db174adee2d23d982:4b74dca0219bad629852191af326a45037346c2231240e0f7aec1f9371cc14e8",
  "v5.0"
);

let query = api.users.read({
  email: "philippe@ts-ghost.com"
});

// or

let query = api.users.read({
  id: "edHks74hdKqhs34izzahd45"
});
```

### Not recommended:

You can submit **both** `id` and `email`, but the fetcher will then chose the `id` in priority if present to make the final URL query to the Ghost API.

```ts
let query = api.users.read({
  id: "edHks74hdKqhs34izzahd45", // id will take priority
  email: "philippe@ts-ghost.com",
});
```

The order of preference is `id` > `slug` > `email`.

## Output modifiers

After calling `read` you get a Fetcher instance that you can use to optionnaly alter the output of the result with methods like `include`, `fields` and `formats`. You can also skip that and use the `fetch` method directly to get the result.

There is a section [dedicated to output modifiers here](/docs/content-api/output-modifiers).

## Fetching the data

After using browse query, you will get a `ReadFetcher` with an async `fetch` method.
That result is a discriminated union with the Boolean `success` as a discriminator, so a check on `success` will let you know if the query was successful or not. Generally your workflow will look like that:

```ts
let result = await api.posts.read({ slug: "this-is-a-slug" }).fetch();
if (result.success) {
  const posts = result.data;
  //     ^? type Post
} else {
  // errors array of objects
  console.log(result.errors.map((e) => e.message).join("\n"));
}
```

### Result type of `.fetch()`

The `data` property of the result will be an object corresponding to the resource you requested. This output schema will be modified according to the output modifiers you used.

**Basic example for Post** (without output modifiers you get the full Post object):

```ts
// example for the read query (the data is an object)
const result: {
    success: true;
    data: Post; // parsed by the Zod Schema and modified by the fields selected
} | {
    success: false;
    errors: {
        message: string;
        type: string;
    }[];
}
```
