# Overview

Here you will have an overview of the philosophy of the library and a common workflow for your queries.

The `TSGhostAdminAPI` object is your entry-point, it will contains all the available endpoints and need to be instantiated with your Ghost Blog API Credentials, the URL, and the Admin API Key.

```ts
import { TSGhostAdminAPI } from "@ts-ghost/admin-api";

const api = new TSGhostAdminAPI(
  "https://demo.ghost.io",
  "1efedd9db174adee2d23d982:4b74dca0219bad629852191af326a45037346c2231240e0f7aec1f9371cc14e8",
  "v6.0",
);
```

From this `api` instance you will be able to call any resource available in the Ghost Admin API and have the available methods exposed.

## Available resource

| Resource            | `.read()` | `.browse()` | `.add()` | `.edit()` | `.delete()` |
| ------------------- | --------- | ----------- | -------- | --------- | ----------- |
| `api.posts`         | ‚úÖ        | ‚úÖ          | ‚úÖ       | ‚úÖ        | ‚úÖ          |
| `api.pages`         | ‚úÖ        | ‚úÖ          | ‚úÖ       | ‚úÖ        | ‚úÖ          |
| `api.members`       | ‚úÖ        | ‚úÖ          | ‚úÖ       | ‚úÖ        | ‚úÖ          |
| `api.tiers`         | ‚úÖ        | ‚úÖ          | -        | -         | -           |
| `api.newsletters`   | ‚úÖ        | ‚úÖ          | ‚úÖ       | ‚úÖ        | üóÑÔ∏è\*        |
| `api.offers`        | ‚úÖ        | ‚úÖ          | ‚úÖ       | ‚úÖ        | üóÑÔ∏è\*        |
| `api.tags`          | ‚úÖ        | ‚úÖ          | ‚úÖ       | ‚úÖ        | ‚úÖ          |
| `api.users`         | ‚úÖ        | ‚úÖ          | -        | -         | -           |
| `api.webhooks`      | -         | -           | ‚úÖ       | ‚úÖ        | ‚úÖ          |
| `api.site` \*\*     | -         | -           | -        | -         | -           |
| `api.settings` \*\* | -         | -           | -        | -         | -           |

- üóÑÔ∏è\* _You have access to a "soft" delete via the `status` field with values `"active" | "archived"`._
- \*\* `site` and `settings` resources only have a `fetch` function exposed, no query builder.

Calling any resource like `members` or `posts` will give your a new instance of APIComposer containing a mix of exposed methods between `read`, `browse` for data fetching and `add`, `edit` and `delete` for mutation.

In this Admin API the schemas returned are different from the [@ts-ghost/content-api](/docs/content-api) and have usually more data. For example the `Post` resource can give you access to the paid `tiers` required to have access to the content.

## Building Queries (Read / Browse)

The resource instance is already built with the associated Schema for that resource so any operation
you will do from that point will be typed against the asociated schema. Since you are using TypeScript you will get a nice developer experience with autocompletion and squiggly lines if you try to use a field that doesn't exist on the resource.

`browse` and `read` methods accept an options object. These params mimic the way Ghost API Admin is built but with the power of Zod and TypeScript they are type-safe here.

```ts
let query = api.members.browse({
  limit: 5,
  order: "name ASC",
  //      ^? the text here will throw a TypeScript lint error if you use unknown field.
});
```

- `browse` will accept `page`, `limit`, `order`, `filter`. ([More details](/docs/admin-api/browse))
- `read` parameters are `id` or `slug`. ([More details](/docs/admin-api/browse))

## (Optional) Altering the output

After calling `read` or `browse` you get a Fetcher instance that you can use to optionnaly alter the output of the result.

For example if we want to fetch only the id, name and email of your members we could do:

```ts
let query = api.members
  .browse({
    limit: 5,
    order: "email ASC",
  })
  .fields({
    id: true,
    email: true,
    name: true,
  });
```

## Fetching the data

After building your query and _optionnaly using output formatting_, you can fetch it with the **async** `fetch` method. This method will return a `Promise` that will resolve to a result object that was parsed by the `Zod` Schema of the resource.

```ts
let query = await api.members
  .browse({
    limit: 5,
    order: "email ASC",
  })
  .fields({
    id: true,
    email: true,
    name: true,
  })
  .fetch();

// or without fields selection

let query2 = await api.members
  .browse({
    limit: 5,
    order: "email ASC",
  })
  .fetch();
```

Alternatively, coming from a `browse` query you also have access to the `paginate` method, instead of `fetch`. This version will return a cursor and a `next` fetcher to directly have the next query with the same parameters but on page n + 1. See a complete example in the [Common Recipes](/docs/admin-api/common-recipes) section.

The result is a **discriminated union** with the Boolean `success` as a discriminator, so a check on `success` will let you know if the query was successful or not. The shape of the "OK" path depends on the query you made and the output modifiers you used.

```ts
const result: {
    success: true;
    data: Member; // Shape depends on resource + browse | read + output modifiers
    // contains aditionnal metadata for browse queries
} | {
    success: false;
    errors: {
        message: string;
        type: string;
    }[];
}
```

## Mutations (Add / Edit / Delete)

The `add`, `edit` and `delete` methods are available on the resources that support it. (For example on `user` you don't have access to any mutation methods).
You will get auto-completion from each resource if the different methods are available or not.

**These methods are all asynchronous** (no need to call a fetch method to execute them) and will return a result object with the same shape as query methods (except for delete).

Examples:

```ts
import { TSGhostAdminAPI } from "@ts-ghost/admin-api";

let url = "https://demo.ghost.io";
let key = "1efedd9db174adee2d23d982:4b74dca0219bad629852191af326a45037346c2231240e0f7aec1f9371cc14e8";
const api = new TSGhostAdminAPI(url, key, "v6.0");

// Input data are fully typed and then parsed through the appropriate Zod Schema
const adding = await api.posts.add({
  title: title,
  html: "<p>Hello from ts-ghost</p>",
  tags: [{ name: "ts-ghost" }],
  tiers: [{ name: "ts-ghost" }],
  custom_excerpt: "This is custom excerpt from ts-ghost",
  meta_title: "Meta Title from ts-ghost",
  meta_description: "Description from ts-ghost",
  featured: true,
  og_title: "OG Title from ts-ghost",
  og_description: "OG Description from ts-ghost",
  twitter_title: "Twitter Title from ts-ghost",
  twitter_description: "Twitter Description from ts-ghost",
  visibility: "public",
  slug: "foobarbaz",
});

if (!adding.success) {
  console.error(adding.errors);
  throw new Error("Failed to create post");
}

const newPost = adding.data;
//     ^? type Post

// Update
const postEdit = await api.posts.edit(newPost.id, {
  custom_excerpt: "Modified excerpt from ghost",
  // This is required by Ghost to send the updated_at field with the updated_at
  // of the post you want to edit.
  updated_at: new Date(newPost.updated_at || ""),
});

if (!postEdit.success) {
  console.error(postEdit.errors);
  throw new Error("Failed to edit post");
}

const editedPost = postEdit.data;
//     ^? type Post

// Delete
const postDelete = await api.posts.delete(editedPost.id);
if (!postDelete.success) {
  console.error(postDelete.errors);
  throw new Error("Failed to delete post");
}
```
