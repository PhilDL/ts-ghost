# Edit

Edit lets you edit an existing record of a given resource by inputing the resource `id` and the new data. The `edit` method is available on the resources that support it. (For example on the `users` resource don't have access to any mutation methods).

The `edit` method is asynchronous and accept the `id`, the data object and an optional `option` object. The shapes given to the data and the option are fully typed so you will benefit from auto-completion and missing required fields. The `option` is also typesafe and will be available on some resources (most resource don't have options).

You will benefit also from **run-time validation**, the data you input will be parsed before being send through the network.

## Example editing members

Here we want to edit a Member to attach a `stripe_customer_id` to it and we will give the option to not send an email to the member because we want to handle that ourself.

```ts
import { TSGhostAdminAPI } from "@ts-ghost/admin-api";

const api = new TSGhostAdminAPI(
  "https://demo.ghost.io",
  "1efedd9db174adee2d23d982:4b74dca0219bad629852191af326a45037346c2231240e0f7aec1f9371cc14e8",
  "v6.0",
);

const membersEdit = await api.members.edit(
  "edHks74hdKqhs34izzahd45",
  { stripe_customer_id: "cus_123456789" },
  { send_email: false },
);
```

## Result

The result will be parsed and typed with the `output` schema and represent the newly created record.

```ts
// return from the `edit` method
const result: {
    success: true;
    data: Member;
} | {
    success: false;
    errors: {
        message: string;
        type: string;
    }[];
}
```
