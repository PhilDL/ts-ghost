# Add

Add lets you create a new record of a given resource. The `add` method is available on the resources that support it. (For example on the `users` resource don't have access to any mutation methods).

The `add` method is asynchronous and accept a data object and an optional `option` object. The shapes given to the data and the option are fully typed so you will benefit from auto-completion and missing required fields. The `option` is also typesafe and will be available on some resources (most resource don't have options).

You will benefit also from **run-time validation**, the data you input will be parsed before being send through the network.

## Simple example without options

Here we create a Post with the minimum required fields: `title`:

```ts
import { TSGhostAdminAPI } from "@ts-ghost/admin-api";

const api = new TSGhostAdminAPI(
  "https://demo.ghost.io",
  "1efedd9db174adee2d23d982:4b74dca0219bad629852191af326a45037346c2231240e0f7aec1f9371cc14e8",
  "v6.0",
);

const postAdd = await api.posts.add({
  title: title,
});
```

## Create a member (with options)

The `members` resource accept an option to send an email or not to the member:

```ts
import { TSGhostAdminAPI } from "@ts-ghost/admin-api";

const api = new TSGhostAdminAPI(
  "https://demo.ghost.io",
  "1efedd9db174adee2d23d982:4b74dca0219bad629852191af326a45037346c2231240e0f7aec1f9371cc14e8",
  "v6.0",
);

const memberAdd = await api.members.add(
  { name: "Philippe", email: "philippe@ts-ghost.com" },
  { send_email: false },
);
```

## Result

The result will be parsed and typed with the `output` schema and represent the newly created record.

```ts
// return from the `add` method
const result: {
    success: true;
    data: Member; // parsed by the Zod Schema given in the config
} | {
    success: false;
    errors: {
        message: string;
        type: string;
    }[];
}
```
