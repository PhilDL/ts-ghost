# Migrating from Ghost SDK

## Introduction

Ghost SDK is a great library to interact with the Ghost Content API. It is a very mature library, but if you prefer a more strongly typed and checked library you can use this one. Generally speaking, the API is very similar, but there are some differences.

## Common "gotchas"

Filtering posts by `author` or `tag` is not supported. You can only filter by `authors` or `tags` (plural).

```ts title
import { TSGhostAdminAPI, type Post } from "@ts-ghost/admin-api";

const api = new TSGhostAdminAPI(env.GHOST_URL, env.GHOST_ADMIN_API_KEY, "v6.0");

let posts: Post[] = [];
let cursor = await api.posts
  .browse({ filter: "tags:hash-tag" })
  .include({ authors: true, tags: true })
  .fetch();
if (result.success) {
  posts = result.data;
}
return posts
```

### Why ?

The Ghost Content API is a bit inconsistent in the way it handles filtering. For example, you can filter by `authors` but also by `author`. The same goes for `tags` and `tag`. But in the result `author` and `tag` are not present, it's only `primary_author`, `authors`, `primary_tag`, `tags`. So ts-ghost tries to be more consistent and only supports filtering by attributes present on the result object.
