# Delete

Delete is an async function that requires the `id` of the record to delete. _Some resources don't support deletion, but instead give you accessed to a soft delete through the `status` field in the `edit` method._

The only argument is the `id` of the record to delete, in this example we delete a member.

```ts
import { TSGhostAdminAPI } from "@ts-ghost/admin-api";

const api = new TSGhostAdminAPI(
  "https://demo.ghost.io",
  "1efedd9db174adee2d23d982:4b74dca0219bad629852191af326a45037346c2231240e0f7aec1f9371cc14e8",
  "v6.0",
);
const result = await api.members.delete("edHks74hdKqhs34izzahd45");

if (!result.success) {
  console.error(result.errors);
  throw new Error("Failed to delete Member");
}
```

## Result

The response will not contain any data since Ghost API just return a 204 empty response. You will have to check the discriminator `success` to know if the deletion was successful or not.

```ts
// return from the `delete` method
const result: {
    success: true;
} | {
    success: false;
    errors: {
        message: string;
        type: string;
    }[];
}
```
